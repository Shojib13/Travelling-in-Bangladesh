        <b><u>Kuakata Beach:</u></b><br> Kuakata offers a full view of the sunrise and sunset from the same white sandy beach in the water of the Bay of Bengal. Locally known as Shagor Kannya (Daughter of ocean), the long strip of dark, marbled sand stretches for about 18 kilometres (11 mi). The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach has gentle slopes into the Bay of Bengal. Kuakata is also a sanctuary for migratory winter birds. On the eastern end of the beach is Gongamati Reserved Forest, an evergreen mangrove forest and snippet of the original Kuakata. When the Rakhines settled in the area in 1784, Kuakata was part of the larger Sundarbans forest. However, the Sundarbans is now at a distance of one-hour by speed boat. As a mangrove forest, Gongamati, like the Sundarbans, offers some protection against tidal surges, however it too is being threatened by logging and deforestation. The best way to reach the forest is by foot or bike along the beach, where a flock of flag flying fishing boats can be seen trawling the coast. Choosing to visit Gangamati in the late afternoon is a perfect time to watch the sun cast shadows on the abstract exposed mangrove roots.

        <b><u>Lebur char:</u></b><br> Lebur chor is located at five (5) kilometer east of Kuakata beach. Lebur (Lemon) chor is locally also known as Lembur chor or ‘Nembur chor’. Surrounded area of this chor is about 1000 acres. lebur bon Lebur Bon, Kuakata There are many types of trees and plants in this chor like Keura, Geowa, Goran, Koroi, Golpata etc. Lebur chor is the part of Sundarban but now it is detached from Sundarban. It is situated in the east corner of Kuakata. So traveler can visit from Kuakata to Lebur chor easily. Lebur chor will be another attractive place for the Kuakata travelers. It is full of natural beauty and this place is totally outstanding. <br><br>

        <b><u>The Guthia Mosque</u></b><br> The Baitul Aman Jame Masjid Complex, commonly known as Guthia Mosque of Barisal, is a mosque complex of Bangladesh having a land area of 14 acres, comparing to the 8.30 acres land area of the national mosque Baitul Mukarram of the country.The Baitul Aman Jame Masjid Complex consists of a Mosque, a huge Eidgah, a graveyard, three lakes, Madrasa and an orphanage.Established on December 16, 2003, Guthia Mosque is also a tourist spot in Bangladesh. Construction of the mosque complex began in December 16, 2003 under the supervision of SAS Foundation.The complex is a private initiative by Sharfuddin Ahmed, a local politician, and a businessman.The mosque took four years and one month to be completed. The complex was designed by a group of Bangladeshi architects. The cost of the construction in those times was 200 million BDT. The complex was inaugurated on October 20, 2006, with three great lakes, a mosque, an orphanage, a madrasa, an Eidgah and 58 meters high minaret constructed of white marble <br><br>

        <b><u>The GUAVA MARKET:</u></b><br> The southern region of Bangladesh is famous for guavas, more popularly known in Bangladesh as 'Bengal's Apple'. Specially in Jhalokathi Sadar Upazila and at Swarupkathi and Banaripara Upazila in Pirozpur, farmers heavily rely on guava farming. Such diversity of life is hardly to be found in other places of the country. Loss in guava farming in one season usually leads to extreme distress for the farmers throughout the year. The current year is one of those. Very recently I went to visit these canals of Barisal and wondered whether I am actually roaming around Venice or not. The floating guava market at Bhimruli over Kirtipasha canal was simply majestic. I spoke with farmer Amal Bishwas who purchased a 1.5 bigha (measurement of land) guava orchard few months back for Tk. 25,000. Six to seven maunds (unit of weight) of guava are collected every day from his orchard. The methods of collecting guava from the tree are very tricky. Farmers are now finding it really tough because of the low market price. The price of guava per KG is Tk. 2 or 3. According to the farmers, the prices get even lower than this, going down to 10 taka per maund! In this circumstance, it's getting difficult for Amal to work really hard from dawn to dusk along with his wife Anjali to acquire his desired profit. “It takes 10,000 taka to 15,000 taka of labour cost and our family members are working to save that cost”, says Anjali. All the guavas become ripened due to the constant heavy rain just few days ago, and it's now a challenge to sell these guavas in the market. Amal's hope of getting a market price of Tk. 200 per maund is just a dream now. <br><br>
