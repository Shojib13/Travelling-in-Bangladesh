        <b><u> Muktagacha Palace: </u></b><br> Mymensingh city is one of the old cities in Bangladesh. Historically & archaeologically it is very important from tourism point of views. Once a traveler wants to travel in this district, he/she will find several places to visit. Muktagacha Zamindar House is one of those. This old palace is located at the heart of the MuktagachaUpazila, 16km west to the Sadar Upazila. Previously the name of Muktagacha was Binodbari .It is believed that the Zamindars actually came from the Natore or Bogra of our North Bengal. When the first ruler named Srikrishna Acharya arrived here, a local inhabitant named Muktaram Kormokar welcomed them with a large lamp stand that was made from brass. In that portion of our country, people call a lamp stand as Gachha. This gratitude pleased the Zamindar and they have renamed the area as Muktagacha using that inhabitant’s name and the lamp stand’s local name. <br><br>


        <b><u> Mymensingh Museum: </u></b><br> Mymensingh Museum (Mymensingh Jadughar) is located at the bagan bari("garden house") of zamindar Madan Babu at 17 Amrita Babu Road, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The museum, which began as an important regional institution for preservation of locally collected historical evidence, lacks proper preservation. Its objective is to preserve the rare and unique relics of local architecture, sculpture, metal works, utensils, handwritten scripts on paper and leaf, and commercial products. Collected from the palaces of Mymensingh District zamindars, the museum's initial collection included 214 articles. They are housed in three rooms within the museum. The museum was established in 1969 at the initiative of the-then Deputy Commissioner of Mymensingh.Initially run by the Mymensingh Municipality, the Department of Archaeology, Cultural Affairs Ministry took charge of the museum in 1989.By 1995, it was enlisted in the gazette. The collection includes manuscripts and coins, though many are not on display due to insufficient showcase space. A peacock mummy comes from Mymensingh Medical College. Bamboo and cane items, preserved birds, photographs and pottery were damaged during a renovation in 1999–2001. Several articles were collected from zamindar palaces. The Muktagacha zamindar palace contribution includes a stone flower vase, a compass, antique clocks, Bakharee (an ornament), pottery, weaving machines, ornamental flower tub stands, candle stands, iron shelves and sports items; statuary and sculptures include those of Saraswati, Vishnu, and a dragon; natural history items include a tiger head, two deer heads, and the head of a wild bull.[2] Elephant heads, a sofa set, Italian statues, and a huge shade used during hunting come from the Gouripur zamindar palace.
